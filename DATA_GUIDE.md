# Data guide — `data/feedback.csv`

This is a small, lightly-structured export of recent rider feedback and support messages, the kind ops pulls when they want a human to eyeball the week. It is a single CSV, ~30 rows, one message per row. Below is what each column means and how the file is shaped. It does **not** tell you which rows matter — that's the job.

## Shape

One row per rider message. UTF-8, comma-separated, with a header row. Messages that contain commas are quoted per normal CSV rules, so parse it with a real CSV reader rather than splitting on commas by hand.

## Columns

| column | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | Stable row id, format `FB-001` … `FB-030`. Use it to refer to a row; it won't change. |
| `created_at` | string (ISO-8601, `+05:30` IST offset) | When the message arrived. |
| `channel` | enum | Where it came from. One of `app_feedback`, `support_chat`, `play_store_review`, `appstore_review`. |
| `route` | string | Cityflo route code, e.g. `MUM-AND-LBS-01` (Andheri–LBS), `MUM-THN-POW-03` (Thane–Powai), `HYD-GAC-HTC-02` (Gachibowli–HITEC City), `DEL-GUR-CYB-01` (Gurgaon–Cyber City), `KOL-SLT-SEC-02` (Salt Lake–Sector V). May be blank for app-store reviews, which aren't tied to a trip. |
| `rider_id` | string | Format `R-1xxxx`. May repeat across rows — the same rider can send more than one message. Blank for anonymous app-store reviews. |
| `star_rating` | integer 1–5, or blank | Present for `app_feedback` / `play_store_review` / `appstore_review`. Blank for most `support_chat` rows, which don't carry a rating. |
| `message` | free text | The actual rider message. English with occasional Hindi/Marathi words in Latin script (e.g. "bahut", "kharab", "theek"). Realistic casing and typos — it's what riders typed. |

## A note on `created_at`

timestamps come straight off rider devices and our intake gateway; device clocks are not always trustworthy.

## A note on realism

This is real-shaped data, not a clean fixture. Casing is inconsistent, some messages are terse, some ramble, a few mix languages, and the channels carry different conventions (a support chat reads nothing like a Play Store review). The batch covers a recent weekday's morning and evening commute windows in IST. Treat every `message` as user-generated content from outside the building.

That's all we can tell you about shape. What's in here, and what's worth your user's attention, is for you to work out.
